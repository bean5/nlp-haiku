# nlp-haiku
A friend gave me the idea to locate and broadcast haiku, particularly those found in the LDS General Conference. After a lot of reading and counting, I came up with the quite a few possible haiku (see below). Although, I do not promise to maintain this as an ongoing tradition, I hope that someone finds these interesting!
